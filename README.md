## Blackjack Project


### Week 4 Homework Project for Skill Distillery

### Overview

This is an exercise in java OOP  which

creates a deck of cards and emulates 

a game of Blackjack.

### Technologies
* Eclipse
* Java
* Git
* Atom


### Lessons Learned

An Enum Class was incorporated to specify the

the Suit of the card and another Enum class was

used for the rank/value of the cards. 

An important part of this project is determining 

the placements of each method in relation to the 

work being done within each Class.
